This package of functions is designed to process data simultaneously collected with a pupil labs eye tracker and a motion shadow mobile motion capture system.

%% dependencies %%
This package is dependent on:
quaternion; https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33341-quaternion

plane_line_intersect; https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/17751-straight-line-and-plane-intersection


%% main function descriptions %%
processData.m: processes entire data collection sessions from the eye tracker and the mobile mo-cap system.

splitWalks.m: takes processed data from a single session and breaks it into individual ‘walks’ based on provided frame numbers

exampleProcessData.m: two examples given data that we both have
